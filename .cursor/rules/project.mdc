Project name:
DeepSearch

Project goal:
The user should give a URL and a query, and we should be able to answer the query using information from the given website with high-fidelity.

Coding guidlines:
Code quality is paramount. Good engineering approaches such as clean code and domain-driven design (by Eric Evans and Vaughn Vernon) should be followed. That said, we should remain pragmatic and adapt the solution to best solve the problem.

Respect current code style and existing working code. Don't break existing working code.
